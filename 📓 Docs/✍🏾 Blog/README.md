README: /blog/

This folder contains personal essays, technical reflections, and cultural commentary written by me — a Pan-African technologist, educator, and father.

These blog entries document my thoughts on technology, legacy, and identity as I build across multiple disciplines.

✍🏾 Topics I Write About:
• Tech + Identity: Navigating the tech world as a Black developer and Pan-African thinker
• Data With Purpose: Why we must teach data literacy and ownership in our communities
• Fatherhood + Code: Raising my kids with logic, creativity, and discipline through programming
• STEM Education: Reflections on teaching coding to children in underserved communities
• Game Development: Afro-futurist design, narrative play, and educational game mechanics

• raising_coders_in_the_diaspora.md
• building_black_owned_games.md

💡 Purpose:

This space exists to document the philosophy behind my code — why I build, who I build for, and how legacy shapes my tech journey.

“Code is culture. And culture, when nurtured, becomes future.”
